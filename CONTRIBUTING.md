### Before working on a new feature

- Tell us about the feature you wanna make so we can make sure your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It would be a waste if your and our time if it does not fit.

### Pull Requests

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository, so we can efficiently review the changes.
