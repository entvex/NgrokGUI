<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

NgrokGUI is a windows GUI for ngrok. It helps download ngrok, getting it ready for first time use and managing tunnels. The idea for the project arose due to friends wanting a gui to ngrok that was more user friendly.
I later found a Dungeons & Dragons community that uses [Foundryvtt](https://foundryvtt.com/) to run their games. NgrokGUI allows an easy way for the dungeon master to host the game without spending additional money on hosting or messing with port forwarding.

#### ðŸ”¨ New version underway! ðŸ”¨
I have gotten requests for this application to be ported to Linux and Mac as well. Therefore, I am in the process of rewriting the application in avaloniaui.
Look at the v2 branch if you wanna follow the progress
